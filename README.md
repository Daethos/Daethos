## [Seyr](http://ascea.herokuapp.com/)
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Apologies for the lack of polish on this end, currently working on the 'Seyr' repo every day to get it up and running.

#### [Current Update]: Gear is now uniquely randomized in every occurrence, Tutorial Demo before signing up allows a prospective player to try the combat system without a profile.
#### [Past Updates]: Leveling, Inventory, Dialog, PvP, Social aspects, Readme -- Story work in progress. Mobile experience recommended.
##### Note(s): Built-In tutorial for combat explanation complete.
