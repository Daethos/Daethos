### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Apologies for the lack of polish on this end, currently working on 'Seyr' repo every day to get it up and running.

### [Current Update]: Game is operational for gameplay testing at Http://ascea.herokuapp.com/
#### Note: No built-in readme/tutorial as of 11-14. Will work to have that in before Thanksgiving, at least for general app functionality.
