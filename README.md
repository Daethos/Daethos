## [Seyr of Daethos](http://ascea.herokuapp.com/)
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Apologies for the lack of polish on this end, currently working on the 'Seyr [of Daethos]' game repo every day to get it up and running.

#### [Current Update]: Revamped system to initiate progression elements, disparity of equipment, experience/leveling, looting, inventory, dialog.
#### [Past Updates]: PvP, Social aspects, Readme -- Story work in progress. Mobile experience recommended.
##### Note(s): Built-In tutorial for combat complete, under the 'Actions' tab, the first tab in any dialog box.
