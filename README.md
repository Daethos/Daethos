## [Seyr of Daethos](http://ascea.herokuapp.com/)
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Apologies for the lack of polish on this end, currently working on the 'Seyr [of Daethos]' game repo every day to get it up and running.

#### [Current Update]: Game is functional for PvP! Took a bit of work retooling previous logic for solo gameplay and enhancing the experience via sockets.
#### [Past Update]: Game is operational for social and gameplay testing -- story and pvp still work in progress. Mobile experience recommended.
##### Note(s): No built-in readme/tutorial as of 11 November 2022. Will work to have that in before Thanksgiving, for general app functionality if not combat. [11/23 Update]: Failed to create the readme/tutorial, but as a surprise tradeoff I've managed to create the PvP experience!
