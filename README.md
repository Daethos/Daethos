## [Seyr of Daethos](http://ascea.herokuapp.com/)
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Apologies for the lack of polish on this end, currently working on the 'Seyr [of Daethos]' game repo every day to get it up and running.

#### [Current Update]: Readme has been written, solo and pvp gameplay working thoroughly.
#### [Past Updates]: Game is functional for PvP via socket.io! Game is operational for social and gameplay testing -- story and pvp still work in progress. Mobile experience recommended.
##### Note(s): No built-in tutorial for the gameplay mechanics or combat experience as of 12/1. Will work to complete that before Christmas.
